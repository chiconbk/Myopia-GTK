## Warning

This is a work in progress. It has some bugs still.

The blur doesn't work, it uses transparency only.

There will be a light theme soon.

## Installation

To install, copy one of the themes on the 'Themes' folder and paste it on '~/.themes', and select the theme in Gnome Tweaks.

### Donate! 

Making this theme real and good takes a lot of time of designing and coding. So if you like the project, consider donating to keep me motivated maintaining it :)
