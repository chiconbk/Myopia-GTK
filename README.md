# Myopia Theme for GTK+

![](.screenshots/screenshot.png)

## Warning

This is a work in progress. It has some bugs still.

The blur doesn't work, it uses transparency only.

This theme is based on Adwaita, but you don't need it to install this theme ;)

## Installation

To install, copy one of the themes on the 'Themes' folder and paste it on '~/.themes', and select the theme in Gnome Tweaks.

## Notes

There'll be a light theme, an opaque theme and maybe a squared version.

### Donate! 

Making this theme real and good takes a lot of time of designing and coding. So if you like the project, consider donating to keep me motivated maintaining it :)
